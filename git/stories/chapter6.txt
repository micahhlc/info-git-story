The Last Hope

Kenji wiped his hands on his apron, staring at the nearly empty streets of Tokyo. It was past midnight, and only a few late-night workers slurped their ramen under his stall’s flickering neon light.

Then, the sky darkened.

At first, he thought it was a blackout, but when he looked up, his breath caught—a massive ship hovered silently above the city, stretching across the sky like a second moon. Not a single alarm sounded. No one screamed. Everything was frozen in eerie stillness.

A beam of soft blue light descended before him. From it stepped a figure—tall, humanoid, yet its body shimmered like flowing mercury. Its face lacked a mouth, but its glowing blue eyes locked onto Kenji.

“We need help.” The words echoed inside his mind, clear as if spoken aloud.

Kenji swallowed. “Help… with what?”

The alien tilted its head. “A war is coming. Earth is the last hope.”

Kenji’s hands trembled. He was just a ramen vendor. What could he do against an interstellar war?

Before he could ask, the alien extended its hand, placing a small, pulsing device in his palm. The moment he touched it, his mind exploded with visions—planets burning, towering war machines, an army of monstrous creatures devouring worlds. Then, he saw Tokyo, crumbling beneath an approaching shadow.

He gasped, dropping the device. The alien’s gaze did not waver.

“You have been chosen.”

Then, the ship vanished, and the city returned to normal, the neon lights buzzing as if nothing had happened.

But in Kenji’s hand, the device still pulsed, whispering secrets he wasn’t ready to understand.

His simple life was over.

The ship appeared over Tokyo, silent and massive, blotting out the stars. Kenji, a late-night ramen vendor, froze as a glowing figure descended. The alien, shimmering like liquid silver, extended a hand.

“We need help,” it whispered in flawless Japanese.

Kenji’s heart pounded. “Help… with what?”

The alien’s eyes darkened. “A war is coming. And Earth is the last hope.”

A second later, the ship vanished, leaving behind a small, humming device. As Kenji reached for it, a message echoed in his mind—“You have been chosen.”

His simple life was over.
